=== SESSION S0003 CONTINUATION === 2026-01-29T06:30:00Z
Focus: Fixing UI issues - button icon alignment and missing table actions column

S0003. UI Fix #1 - Button Icon Alignment:
- User feedback: "buttony maja z jakiegos powodu ikone nie inkline z tekstem"
- Root cause: Icons were passed as children instead of using iconLeading prop
- Fixed BulkActionBar.tsx to use iconLeading prop for all buttons
- Fixed test-patterns page to pass icon components (not elements)
- Updated type signatures: icon?: FC<{ className?: string }> | React.ReactNode
- Result: Icons now properly inline with button text

S0003. UI Fix #2 - Missing Table Actions Column:
- User feedback: "w tabeli brakuje actions po prawej stronie"
- Added RowAction<T> interface to DataTableWithFilters
- Added rowActions prop to DataTableWithFiltersProps
- Implemented actions column header (right-aligned)
- Implemented actions cells with button group for each row
- Added proper event handling (stopPropagation) to prevent row click conflicts
- Updated test-patterns page with example row actions (Edit, Delete)
- Result: Table now shows actions column on right side

S0003. Dashboard Example Download:
- User message: "Pobierz ten dashoard npx untitledui@latest example dashboards-01/02"
- Downloaded using: npx untitledui@latest example dashboards-01/02 -e src/app -p components
- Created src/app/dashboards-02.tsx with complete dashboard reference
- Example includes: sidebar navigation, metrics charts, sortable tables, pagination, tabs
- Shows desired UI appearance for the monitoring system
- Result: Have reference for desired system UI appearance
