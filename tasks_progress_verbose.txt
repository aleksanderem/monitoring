Task Progress Log - Monitoring Dashboard Implementation
=============================================================

[Previous session history preserved above...]

=== SESSION S0010 START === 2026-01-31T10:00:00Z
Focus: Implementing comprehensive monitoring enhancements from context analysis
Continuing from: S0009 (completed - all backlinks features working, 1649 backlinks fetched)
Active tasks: Planning phase

---

S0010. Context Analysis Complete:
The user provided comprehensive executive analysis document covering:
- Current architecture and feature state
- 10 identified opportunity areas with implementation details
- 4-phase implementation roadmap (Quick Wins → Advanced Features)
- Technical debt and optimization recommendations

Key findings from analysis:
✓ Strong technical foundation: Next.js 16, React 19, Convex backend
✓ Core features operational: Keywords (tracking, discovery), Backlinks (1649 fetched), Domains, Multi-tenant
✓ Recent modernization: shadcn/ui charts, bulk actions, tag filtering
✓ Ready for strategic enhancements

---

S0010. Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)**
1. SERP Features Tracking - Monitor featured snippets, PAA, image packs
2. Keyword Grouping/Tagging - Organize keywords into custom groups
3. Enhanced Date Range Picker - Custom date ranges for all charts
4. Backlink Velocity Tracking - Track new/lost backlink rates

**Phase 2: Core Enhancements (3-4 weeks)**
5. Competitor Tracking - Monitor competitor domains and positions
6. Content Gap Analysis - Identify keyword opportunities vs competitors

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (5-8 weeks)**
7. Forecasting & Predictions - Position trends and anomaly detection

S0010. Tasks Created:

Task #1: SERP Features Tracking System
- Schema: serpFeatures table, feature types (featured_snippet, paa, image_pack, video, local_pack)
- Backend: queries/serpFeatures.ts, DataForSEO API integration
- Frontend: SERPFeaturesChart, badges in table, timeline component
- Value: Understand SERP landscape, identify feature opportunities
Status: not_started

Task #2: Keyword Grouping and Tagging System
- Schema: keywordGroups, keywordGroupMemberships (many-to-many), tags array
- Backend: queries/keywordGroups.ts, CRUD + stats queries
- Frontend: GroupManagementModal, group filters, GroupPerformanceChart, inline tag editor
- Value: Better keyword organization, group-based reporting
Status: not_started

Task #3: Enhanced Date Range Picker
- Component: DateRangePicker with calendar, presets, comparison mode
- Integration: All time-series charts (BacklinksHistory, MovementTrend, PositionHistory)
- Features: Custom ranges, compare to previous period, quick comparisons
- Value: Flexible date analysis, period comparisons
Status: not_started

Task #4: Backlink Velocity Tracking
- Schema: backlinkVelocityHistory table, daily metrics (new/lost/net change)
- Backend: queries/backlinkVelocity.ts, cron for daily calculation, anomaly detection
- Frontend: BacklinkVelocityChart (dual-axis), velocity metrics cards, anomaly alerts
- Value: Growth pattern insights, early warning for link loss
Status: not_started

Task #5: Competitor Tracking Foundation
- Schema: competitors, competitorKeywordPositions, competitorComparisons
- Backend: queries/competitors.ts, checkCompetitorPositions action, scheduler job
- Frontend: CompetitorManagement, CompetitorOverviewChart, CompetitorKeywordGapTable
- Value: Competitive intelligence, position benchmarking
Status: not_started
Dependencies: Reuses position checking infrastructure

Task #6: Content Gap Analysis
- Backend: queries/contentGaps.ts, opportunity scoring, topic clustering
- Frontend: ContentGapDashboard, ContentGapTable, OpportunityScoreChart, gap metrics
- Value: Identify keyword opportunities, prioritize content creation
Status: not_started
Dependencies: Requires Task #5 (Competitor Tracking)

Task #7: Forecasting and Predictive Analytics
- Schema: forecasts, anomalies tables
- Backend: queries/forecasts.ts, linear regression, anomaly detection (z-score), cron job
- Frontend: ForecastChart overlay, AnomalyAlertsList, prediction badges, confidence indicators
- Value: Proactive insights, trend predictions, anomaly alerts
Status: not_started
Statistical methods: Linear regression, moving averages, seasonal decomposition

S0010. Implementation Order Rationale:

1-2 are independent and can run parallel
3 enhances all existing charts (broad impact)
4 adds new dimension to backlink analysis (builds on existing backlink infra)
5 required foundation for 6 (dependency)
6 uses competitor data from 5
7 can be built incrementally across all metrics

Estimated complexity:
- Tasks 1-4: Medium complexity (2-3 days each)
- Task 5: High complexity (5-7 days, new domain)
- Task 6: Medium complexity (3-4 days, depends on 5)
- Task 7: High complexity (5-7 days, statistical methods)

---

S0010. Next Actions:
- User to confirm priority or request changes
- Begin with Task #1 (SERP Features) or #2 (Keyword Grouping) as foundation
- Consider running Tasks 1-2 in parallel if resources allow
- Task 3 (Date Picker) can be done anytime, will benefit all charts
