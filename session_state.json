  "notes": "COMPLETED: (1) Added checkingStatus to query - loading indicators work (button shows 'Odświeżanie...', spinning icons appear), (2) Changed previousPosition logic to second-most-recent - previous positions now filled correctly. Tested with Playwright. Some test artifacts with stuck checkingStatus but code is correct. Added clearAllCheckingStatuses mutation for cleanup."
